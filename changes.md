# Production Use Differentiation

## Changes for Google Play Compliance
To ensure "Z" provides unique user value and avoids "generic app" rejection:

### 1. "Close Connections" Focus
- **Changed Home Screen Default:** The app now opens to the **Following** tab by default. This emphasizes *user-curated connections* over algorithmic consumption.
- **Empty States:** The "Following" tab now explicitly prompts users to **Share Profile** to build their network, rather than just saying "No posts".

### 2. Premium UX Polish
- **Haptic Feedback:** Added medium impact haptics to the main navigation bar to improve the tactile experience.
- **Onboarding:** (Previously implemented) 3-step value proposition.

### 3. Safety & Privacy
- **Permissions:** Audit completed.
- **Moderation:** Report/Block flows verified.

These changes align Z with a "Utility for Close Friends" positioning rather than a "Mass Social Media" positioning.
