# Z – Connect with Purpose

Z is a private-first social utility designed for **close friends and family**, not for broadcasting to strangers. It brings back the chronological timeline and meaningful interaction, filtering out algorithmic noise.

## 🔒 Why Z? (The Anti-Clone)
Z is different from other social apps because it prioritizes **intimacy over virality**:

-   **Friends First:** The app opens directly to your "Following" tab (chronological). We don't force an algorithmic feed on you.
-   **Safe Space:** Robust blocking and reporting features ensure your circle remains safe.
-   **Zero Bloat:** No random game ads, no complicated marketplaces—just Zaps (updates), Stories, and Messages.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Connect:** Build a curated network of people you actually know.
-   **Share:** Post text, images, and short videos ("Zaps") to your subscribers.
-   **Stories:** Share ephemeral moments that disappear after 24 hours.
-   **Direct Messages:** Real-time chat with read receipts.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
"Utility, not Addiction."
We use calming colors, haptic feedback for key actions, and clear empty states to make the app feel like a tool you use, not a trap you fall into.
